# Semester Project

## Project 01: Classifying and Predicting the Rating of Women's E-commerce Clothing Reviews
This project was done in a group for experimental purposes in the form of a paper. The project aimed to classify the rating class from the reviews and to get the best performance of the proposed models. The experiment used a dataset obtained for Kaggle called Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews and focused only on the 'Review' and 'Rating' features. The classification divided the review into 3 classes, where ratings 1 and 2 were considered negative, 3 were considered neutral, and 4-5 were considered positive. The model used the combinations of text vectorization and training models, including TF-IDF - SVM, TF-IDF - ANN, and sentenceBERT - BERT. My contribution to the project was to code the BERT model and charge of proofreading the paper. By comparing the models, TF-IDF - ANN obtained the highest accuracy and F1 score with 0.933 accuracy and 0.963 F1 Score.

## Project 02: Machine Learning-based Fake News Detection
This project was done in a group for experimental purposes, where the project aimed to classify whether the news was considered fake or authentic. Also, the project aimed to get the best performance of the proposed models. The experiment used a WELFake dataset and focused on the 'Title', 'Text', and 'Label' features. The model used Doc2Vec for the proposed training models, including the XGBoost and Logistic Regression. My contribution to the project was leading in key findings and taking hypotheses while doing the literature review and evaluating the models. Logistic Regression obtained the highest accuracy and F1 score of 0.91 by comparing the models using cross-validation. The difference was only around 0.008 to the XGBoost.

## Project 03: Speech Emotion Recognition with VanderSentiment and TextBlob
This project was done in a group for literature and experimental purposes, where the project aimed to implement the sentiment analysis of speech-to-text systems using pre-trained models, such as VanderSentiment and TextBlob. I contributed to the project by reviewing the literature and understanding how the pre-trained models work.

## Project 04: Autocomplete Function (Word Completion)
This project was done in a group for experimental purposes, where the project aimed to implement N-grams and grammatical understanding in the autocomplete function. We built the N-grams model from scratch, using up to the quintgram as the N-gram token lists. The suggested word based on the N-gram will then be checked in the grammatical term. The grammar was checked using language_tool_python. I contributed to the project by coding the suggestion generation and grammar checker parts.

## Project 05: AI-based Mobile Application for Helping the Diagnosis of Mental Health
This project was done in a group to build an application which aimed to help improve mental health diagnosis by utilizing AI technology. As the group has yet to find a suitable dataset, we limit our development in determining the sentiment of the patient's voice. The professional could later label the recording based on their finding. I contributed to the project by designing the UI/UX and helping with project management.
